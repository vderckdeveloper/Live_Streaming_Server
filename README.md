## 🎉 Intro

**`✅ This is a Web RTC project made with nest js ✅`** 

This is **`Signal Server`** of Web RTC-based live streaming project

Hey, there! I'm **`SEUNGMIN LEE`** and welcome to the core of my live-streaming journey. 
This project represents where Web RTC(Real-Time Communication) meets seamless real-time video delivery. It’s been fueled by my passion for interactive media, backed by countless hours of coding and fine-tuning 🛠️.

From concept to execution, this project is packed with moments of breakthrough and discovery. Whether it was solving tricky WebRTC challenges or building robust CI/CD pipelines, every piece of it captures those "Wait, what if I try this?" moments followed by "Yes, it worked!" victories 🎯.

Take a deep dive into this live-streaming experience, and get a glimpse of the dedication behind the code 💡. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I did building it!

So, kick back, have a look, and enjoy the ride through **`my coding adventure 😎`**
